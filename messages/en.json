      "smartnx": "I worked on the development of the NxSuite SaaS platform, specialized in omnichannel customer service powered by chatbots. I was responsible for building a dynamic interface using React JS and WebSocket to enable real-time support, ensuring a smooth experience for both operators and clients. I led integrations with external APIs such as VTEX and developed scalable data dashboards with a strong focus on performance. I refactored critical parts of the codebase using Atomic Design, functional programming principles, and best practices like DRY and KISS. I also identified and resolved security vulnerabilities, improving the platform's reliability and stability.",
      "spdata": "I served as a front-end developer and team lead on two healthcare-focused systems built with Vue.js, integrating with government APIs. I developed robust interfaces for internal use in high-reliability environments, prioritizing scalability and clear data visualization. I contributed to architectural decisions, provided technical mentorship to the team, and standardized reusable UI components. The project required strict compliance with technical regulations and a user-centered design approach for critical environments.",
      "axis": "I contributed to several internal projects at Mobfintech, focusing on building real-time interactive dashboards using React and TypeScript. I developed integrations with payment APIs, including Pix transaction support and QR code generation. I helped structure internal component libraries, enforced code standardization, and implemented high-performance, accessible components. The delivered solutions significantly improved data analysis workflows and decision-making for end users.",
      "versatus": "I led the front-end development of the Kosen Energy project, a solution for energy pricing and meteorological data analysis. I designed a decoupled component architecture to support dynamic report generation, advanced filtering, and interactive charts. Beyond the technical implementation with a performance-driven mindset, I actively participated in UX decision-making, improving user flows and overall usability. The enhancements significantly boosted the platform's navigation experience and operational efficiency."
